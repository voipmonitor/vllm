"""Prime-hashed learned n-gram embedding IDs.

``plan`` owns the immutable signed-int64 multiplier and per-head table
geometry together with serving capacity. ``bind`` maps caller-owned runtime
tensors and scratch without allocation. ``run`` will write logical embedding
IDs while leaving committed history immutable.

Exact PyTorch oracles are available from
:mod:`b12x.sequence.ple_hash.reference` and are never runtime fallbacks.
