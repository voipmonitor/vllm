"""Stateful packed Gated Delta Network decode.

The op consumes already-projected and convolved packed Q/K/V plus decay,
update, and output-gate projections. It updates a caller-owned recurrent-state
pool in place, then applies per-value-head RMSNorm and either a SiLU or sigmoid
output gate. Projection GEMMs and causal-convolution state are intentionally
outside this package.

``bind`` / ``run`` implements scalar per-head Qwen GDN decay. ``bind_kda`` /
``run_kda`` implements GLM/Kimi lower-bounded KDA decay from a per-key-coordinate
raw gate while preserving the same state, transaction, and serving lifecycle.
Both recurrence bindings accept live tensor capacities within the plan, so
serving runtimes can bind projection, metadata, and output tensors directly
without staging. Qwen projection rows may be strided views into wider fused
projection outputs.
``Caps.kda_metadata_validation="trusted"`` and
``Caps.qwen_metadata_validation="trusted"`` disable device-side validation for
their respective recurrence when the runtime already guarantees packed-request
geometry, unique active state ownership, and in-range state indices.

The recurrent-state pool uses the optimized physical layout
``[slot, value_head, value_dim, key_dim]``. This is the transpose of the
``[batch, head, key_dim, value_dim]`` state used by slow mathematical PyTorch
references; importing such a state requires transposing its final two axes.
The three inner dimensions must be contiguous. The outer slot stride may be
larger than one logical state to accommodate an aligned paged cache; binding
preserves that stride and never compacts or copies the caller-owned pool.
Pool-scaled slot offsets are computed with 64-bit arithmetic.

Packed requests use fixed-capacity device metadata. Request ``r`` consumes
``query_start_loc[r]:query_start_loc[r + 1]`` and reads its initial checkpoint
from state-index column ``num_accepted_tokens[r] - 1``. Tokens execute
sequentially per request and persist their post-token checkpoints to columns
starting at zero. A one-column plan with one token per request is ordinary
decode. ``Caps.null_state_index`` may reserve one index as a null checkpoint.
Requests whose selected initial checkpoint is null produce zero output without
reading or writing recurrent state; null destination cells are not written.
The default ``None`` leaves every in-range slot, including slot zero, usable.

Planned lifecycle: ``plan(Caps(...))`` -> ``bind`` -> ``run``. Runtime launches
use caller-owned scratch, allocate no tensor storage, and are opaque to
``torch.compile``. Device-side validation is transactional: bit 0 reports a
duplicate active state slot, bit 1 malformed packed metadata, and bit 2 an
invalid active state slot. Any error poisons the complete output without
mutating recurrent state.
