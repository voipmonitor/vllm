"""Small-N BF16 GEMV for decode-time unquantized projections.

The Qwen3.6 GDN block keeps ``in_proj_ba`` in BF16 (its N is far too small to
quantize), and at BS1 decode cuBLAS routes that ``(m<=16, N<=few hundred) x
(N, K)`` GEMM to a 16x16 WMMA tile kernel that runs ~28 us per call — pure
launch/tile overhead for a job whose real traffic is one ~1 MB read of W.
At 48 GDN layers/step that bf16 tail was ~1.35 ms/step in the serving profile.

This kernel does the obvious thing instead: one CTA per output column ``n``,
128 threads strided over K with 128-bit loads of the W row, each thread
carrying ``m`` f32 accumulators (x rows are L2-resident — they are re-read per
CTA, at most ``N * m * K * 2`` bytes through L2, which is noise at these
shapes). bf16 pairs are unpacked with shift/mask bitcasts (no convert
instructions), accumulated in f32, warp+block reduced, and stored as bf16.
Expected cost is ~2-3 us per call vs the ~28 us cuBLAS pick.

Math note: accumulation is f32 in a (thread-strided, tree-reduced) order, the
same accumulator precision cuBLAS uses for bf16 GEMM but a different reduction
order, so results match torch/cuBLAS to bf16 rounding rather than bitwise.

Compiled per ``(m, n, k)`` like the small-M quantizer; decode sees a handful
of m values (1..SMALL_M_MAX), everything larger must use the cuBLAS path.

This module also registers ``b12x::bf16_gemv_small_n`` so a Dynamo /
CUDA-graph path treats the GEMV (compile-cache lookup + CUTE launch) as a
single opaque node. The fallback for shapes the kernel does not cover
(prefill m > SMALL_M_MAX, odd K, misalignment) lives INSIDE the op, so the
calling graph never branches on data-dependent shapes.
