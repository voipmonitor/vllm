"""Trellis codebook registry shared by preparation, planning, and kernels.

A ``trellis_t256`` tile stores 256 tail-biting codes whose 16-bit decode
windows are interpreted by one codebook. The codebook is a model-level
setting; three are defined:

- ``mcg``: multiplicative congruential decode (multiplier ``0xCBAC1FED``)
  with a lop3 mask/or into two added fp16 halves.
- ``sqg_e4m3``: XOR-Cheb-T12 bijection over the retained L16 history with a
  frozen E4M3 reconstruction staircase; defined for K2/K3/K4.
- ``sqg_fp16``: D3L descriptor decode to fp16; defined for uniform K5/K6.

This module is torch-free. Kernel modules embed the ids as compile-time
constants, so the ids participate in kernel cache keys.
