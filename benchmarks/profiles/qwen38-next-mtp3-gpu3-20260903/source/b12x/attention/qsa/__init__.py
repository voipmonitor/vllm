"""Grouped-selector sparse GQA for the Qwen3.8-Flash-Next QSA contract.

QSA keeps exact, original-token BF16 or globally scaled FP8 E4M3 GQA K/V and
uses a second compressed BF16 key cache only to select groups of logical token
positions. The public
lifecycle is ``Caps -> plan -> bind -> prewarm -> run``. Planning owns split
and scratch policy; binding validates tensors and creates references without
allocating. ``prewarm`` compiles large-prefill sparse GQA without reading or
mutating cache state and may be omitted when first-use JIT latency is acceptable.

``run`` executes the decode transaction behind one opaque mutating dispatcher
boundary and never dispatches the slow functions in
:mod:`b12x.attention.qsa.reference`.  The bound main K/V cache and both page
tables are read-only.  The bound output, selected-position matrix, compressed
selector cache, and raw selector state are mutable.  The caller writes the
live original-token K/V before calling ``run``; QSA has no main-cache writer.

Raw selector state is indexed by persistent state slots, not batch indices.
``request_ids[row]`` selects a batch entry and ``raw_state_slot_ids[batch]``
selects its persistent slot; ``-1`` denotes padded work and forbids mutation.
Before assigning a fresh or recycled slot, the caller must fill its logical
and RoPE-position metadata with ``-1``.  Raw-key payload bytes need no
initialization because a key is readable only when its logical-position tag
matches the requested token.  A physical raw page stores the BF16 key payload
first, followed by bit-preserving int64 logical-position tags and RoPE
coordinates in the reserved tail.  ``cache_requirements`` reports whether the
complete raw page fits in one compressed-cache page; ``bind`` enforces that
condition only when the cache manager aliases their allocation slots.

When compressed and raw state share backing pages, every cached request keeps
owning its pages even while it has no rows in the current packed decode call.
Until eviction, the caller must retain that request's valid
``sequence_lengths``, ``compressed_block_table`` entries, and
``raw_state_slot_ids`` mapping.  Zero sequence lengths and ``-1`` table or slot
entries are reserved for unused or evicted capacity, not merely inactive
cached requests.

At the prefill-to-decode handoff for a first decode interval beginning at
logical position ``N``, the state-slot anchor is
``N - num_accepted_tokens``.  The raw ring must contain exact tagged raw keys
and RoPE positions for the trailing incomplete compression group; a decode row
that closes that group consumes the prefill state before overwriting the ring.
The ``-1`` anchor is reserved for initializing position zero with one accepted
token.

Bound cosine and sine tables accept positive-row-stride, unit-inner-stride
views, so the two halves of a combined RoPE table require no copies.  Dynamic
RoPE positions accept non-overlapping positive-stride views, including the
transpose of a native ``[axes, rows]`` MRoPE tensor.

Selected positions are request-relative original-token positions.  Every row
has fixed width ``budget + compress_ratio - 1``; valid positions are packed
first and unused entries are ``-1``.  Completed groups are expanded in their
selected order, followed by the causally visible incomplete-group tail.
``run_selected`` accepts that native selection plus at most one appended
position per configured speculative token. It reads only the main K/V cache
and leaves selector state unchanged.
