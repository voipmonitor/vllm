"""Contiguous (non-paged) attention for SM12x: batched and varlen forward.

BF16/FP16 Q/K/V, including different Q/K and V head dimensions, causal +
sliding-window + attention-sink; tile shapes auto-selected by Q/K head
dimension and causality. ``run`` is the varlen (cu_seqlens)
entry, ``run_batched`` the fixed-shape batched entry; each has its own
plan/scratch/binding family (``create_plan*`` for the per-shape kernel plan,
``plan*`` for scratch sizing).

Example:
    from b12x.attention import varlen

    kplan   = varlen.create_plan_batched(q, k, v, causal=True)
    splan   = varlen.plan_batched(kplan)
    spec    = splan.scratch_specs()[0]
    scratch = torch.empty(spec.shape, dtype=spec.dtype, device=spec.device)
    binding = splan.bind(scratch=scratch, q=q, k=k, v=v, softmax_scale=s)
    out, lse = varlen.run_batched(binding=binding)
