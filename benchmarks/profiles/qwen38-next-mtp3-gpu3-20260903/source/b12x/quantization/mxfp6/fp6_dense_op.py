"""Opaque ``torch.custom_op`` wrapper for the FP6 dense linear.

Registers ``b12x::fp6_dense_linear`` so vLLM's ``torch.compile`` path
(Dynamo fullgraph tracing + CUDA-graph capture) treats the whole FP6 linear —
activation quantization, CUTE kernel JIT lookup, and the block-scaled GEMM
launch — as a single opaque node instead of tracing into the JIT machinery
(tempfile / os.getpid), which previously forced ``--enforce-eager``.

Importing this module performs the registration; ``vllm_plugin`` imports it in
``process_weights_after_loading`` so the op exists in every worker before the
model is compiled.
